Band Website - The Monkees

For my first milestone project I chose to create a website for the band The Monkees.
The band were quite big in the 60's era so I have chosen that theme for aspects of my page including images and colors used.
Using supplied images, video and audio I compliled a comprehensive website that users can use to interact with the band in the method they choose, whether it be viewing slideshows of previous album art via automatic transition carousel, viewing a music video or listening to the bands backcatalogue of select songs.


As the band has been around quite a while , I feel the audience would be an older demographic and it is for this reason I used muted 60s primary colours, a 60's swirl background imageand a simple interface so that the website is easily accesible for all users.



<h3>UX</h3>
As a user of this site, I want to find all the information I want as a fan, to be located at one location, on one website.
As a fan my main wants from a website like this are - information on the band, any relevant news and future live shows.
As a 'potential' fan, I would like some insights into the history of the band, pictures of the members, samples of audio and video and the ability to purchase material from the band website.
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
I used the the Balsamiq app for creating my mockup initially. Although the final design changed slightly as I progressed in its creation.

<h3>Features</h3>
This website comprises of a main navbar which allows users to easily navigate the page to different sections. I decided to create the page as one long continous page with links in order to allow a one-directional scroll action to be the only movement required in order to access further sections and content. The navbar is collapsable when minimized for ease of use on mobile devices.
Bootstrap4 was used in order to utulize a simple grid layout for the website and for the creation of album cover carousel as the main landing feature. 

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
For the future of the project I would like to implement a subtle animated background feature where the background-swirls image I have used currently, would slowly reveolve on its center point. This would really exaggerate the 60's theme I was going for with this design.
I would also like to further develop the store section of the website.


<h3>Testing</h3>

I utilized w3 html & css validator online in order to test my code. I found various discrepencies in my work such as incorrent syntax and formatting . My links to fontawesome were flagging also as as vertical sign (|) was stated as 'not being allowed'. I did not find however that the code was affected by this rule, and further attempts to address it by converting the code using url-escape-text did not seem to alleviate the highlighted error.

My footer links all redirect to Monkees' related social media channels where available, and generic social media channel homepages when unavailable.

All links will redirect to the specified content section of the page.

By clicking on the links in the navbar you will be redirected to content of the page titled in the nav. this makes aceess to desired content instant and intuitive.

This site was tested for responsiveness on all the most popular browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on mobile devices such as samsung s5, iphone 6/7/8/x ipad pro and onto larger screens. During the testing phase, I had my features change position depending on screen size, I added some media queries to counter this. I also at this time fixed my background image in a static positon.

Deployment
This site has been deployed using GitHub pages. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.

To run this file locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://davewalsh3.github.io/MSPone/ into your terminal.
